<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ganiyu Qudus Adekunle, i'm a graduate of the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta(BSC Statistics), i've been on this journey of becoming a Full Stack Software developer since March 2024
  i'm hoping to have learned so much with the help of my mentor Ms Angela Yu by the year 2025, so far ive been focused and discipline bout getting much out of this course and i'm glad to be improving day by day.
</p>

<p>The course is straight-forward and direct as Angela Yu has broken it into easily assimilative pieces for everyone taking the course, i'm about to
  take a step further beacause after roundding up Html, we move to CSS and i really cant wait to know how i can apply the knowledege of Css to my portfolio.
Baby steps. </p>
