		<h2>HELLO NEW AGE</h2>

		<p style="color: blue; font-size: 22px">
			Today is my Birthday, not only that but a new stage of my life begins
			today
		</p>
		<p style="color: rgb(103, 57, 1)">
			I will no longer live day by day,<br />
			Instead i will focus on living in the present, to shape a promising
			future. Its time to wake up, to recognize that i can indeed Grow, That its
			never too late,and that being alive and healthy gives me the opportunity
			to always move forward.<br />
			No more wasting this opportunity.
		</p>

		<p>I KNOW I CAN, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MYSELF.</p>
		<p>
			The fact that i'm celebrating today is the definitive proof that i'm
			destined for Great things. I'm made for Greatness and i will not shrink or
			settle for the comfort of others. I won't allow anyone to set me back, and
			instead of seeing Darkness, i will always seek the light because that's
			what radiates from my being and where i must always advance. I will make
			the most of every seconds as i have the most beautiful gift which is being
			ALIVE.
		</p>
		<p>
			HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME BECAUSE I LOVE AND WILL ALWAYS SURPASS MYSELF. IN A
			YEAR, I WILL KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WAS WORTH IT AND MORE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY
			BRUH, LOVE YOU ALWAYS AND FOREVER.
